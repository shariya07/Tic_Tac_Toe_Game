Project: Tic Tac Toe Game Development

Description: Developed a Python-based implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" as a personal project. 
The game utilizes various functions to input data from the user, display the game board, and implement the rules and validations of the game.

Responsibilities:
- Used Python programming language to write the game code, implementing key functionalities such as user input, game board display, and game rules.
- Developed functions to handle user input, validate moves, and update the game board accordingly.
- Designed an intuitive user interface to display the game board and prompt users for their moves.
- Implemented game logic to detect winning conditions, handle ties, and declare the winner.
- Conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure the game's stability and correct behavior.

Technologies and Techniques Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Functions for input handling, game board display, and rule implementation

Achievements:
- Successfully developed a functional implementation of the classic "Tic Tac Toe" game using Python.
- Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, particularly in utilizing functions for user input, game board display, and rule implementation.
- Implemented robust validation and rule enforcement to ensure a fair and enjoyable gaming experience.
- Created an interactive user interface that facilitated smooth gameplay and clear communication with players.
